What is the problem with the current work?
    HDD accesses are slow
    Number of VMs in a host is every increasing
        More contention
        Each Vm has different workloads and different priorities

What is our vision for the perfect world?
    Little or no contention between VMs
    Fine tune SLAs/ priorities -> maybe
    As cheaply and efficiently as possible

How does our system help with this vision?
    We have different storage devices/systems that we can use such as SSD, PCIe SSD, NVM, etc.
        Each storage has different cost and tradeoffs
        (What do we want to use and why?)
            - We are using the same cache space. So the hit ratio is going to be the same. What we get advantage of is the overall cache latency/utility (l1*h1 + l2*h2 + l3*(1-h1+h2))
    We use a multi tier cache that spans several of those devices
    Our Contributions:
        Partition the cache to different VMs according to their workload and prority
        Calculate HRCs in realtime efficiently using a variation of Mattson's algorithm
        Use a multi constraint optimization algorithm that uses this HRC to allocate resources

For a single cache layer, if the cache is very large, would addressing be a problem?
