Many hosts - large storage devices - slow I/O - not suitable for applications requiring very low latency such as interactive applications. In this paper we present Flash cache, a multi-layer flash based caching technique that improves the latency and throughput by XX\%. We also conduct a cost based analysis. Our implementation uses a two-level caching system, with LRU eviction policy that demonstrates latency improvement upto YY times and throughput by ZZ times for a cost of \$K per GB of cache.
