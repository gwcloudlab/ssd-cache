\section{Related Work}

The most closest work to ours, from which we extended our work upon is by Meng et. al.~\cite{meng_vcacheshare:_2014}. Meng et. al. shows why host-side caching technique is necessary and develops a system \emph{vCacheShare}, a framework that dynamically allocates cache-space at runtime for virtualized environments. We extend their findings and present a case for the need of a two-tier cache and show through our simulation how a two tier can improve the throughput and latency.
